# yuru 

The default grey Yaru folders felt a little drab and I wanted to add some playfulness to my desktop, so I recolored them to the iconic `#87a556` with GIMP üòÅÔ∏èüßâÔ∏è

It's named `Yuru-MATE` after [yaru](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru) and [suru](https://github.com/snwh/suru-icon-theme), which sported vibrant, colorful, lively icons and was once the accompanying icon theme to an older version of the yaru gtk theme


Made with love on Ubuntu MATE 22.04

## usage 

* You can either `git clone` this repository, or download the zip file in the `Releases` tab

* Check to see if the `~/.local/share/icons` folder exists in your system - if it doesn't you can create it yourself by running `mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons`

* place the `Yuru-MATE-light` and `Yuru-MATE-dark` variants in `~/.local/share/icons`

* open the "Appearance" program in Ubuntu MATE, select the theme you want, click `customize`, go to the `Icons` tab, and scroll down until you see `Yuru MATE light` and `Yuru MATE dark`, select those, and you're all set!

### important usage note

Note that you need to keep both variants around as `Yaru MATE Dark`, and consequently `Yuru-MATE-dark` inherit icons from the light variant! 

## license 

Since this is the Yaru MATE icon set with recolored folders, it ships under the same license as the [ubuntu-mate-artwork](https://github.com/ubuntu-mate/ubuntu-mate-artwork/blob/master/COPYING) assets
